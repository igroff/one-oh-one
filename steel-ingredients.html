Carbon
This ingredient is essential to steelâs creation; all steel will have some amount of carbon. 
It is the most important hardening element, but as it is added it can reduce the toughness 
of the material. Carbon reduces the amount that the knife will wear over time. 
So, the amount of carbon in the blade tells you a lot about the quality of the steel. 
Low carbon means there is (.3% or less), medium has between (.4-.7%), and high is (.8% and above). 
Chromium
Combats corrosion. Stainless steel knives will have chromium as a major ingredient,
typicallyat a minimum of 12%. Chromium will also increase the strength of a knife, 
but adding chromium in large amounts decreases toughness.
Cobalt
Strengthens the blade.
Copper
Combats corrosion.
Manganese 
Hardens the blade. If added in high quantities it can increase brittleness.
Molybdenum 
Maintains the steel's strength at high temperatures.
Nickel
Adds toughness.
Nitrogen
This element is sometimes used as a replacement for carbon in steel.
Phosphorus 
Improves strength.
Silicon
Increases strength. Also, removes oxygen from the metal while it is being formed.
Sulfur
Increases machinability but decreases toughness.
Tungsten
Increases wear resistance.
Vanadium
Increases wear resistance and makes the blade harder.
