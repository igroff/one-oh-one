      <li><span class="label">Back Edge / Spine</span> - the blunt edge of the knife opposite the cutting edge.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Belly</span> - The upcurved sharp portion of the blade used for slicing.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Tang</span> - Extension of metal of the blade around which the handle is affixed. Implemented as either a full or hidden tang. In a full tang the metal of the tang extends from the full width of the blade into the handle, whereas the hidden tang is narrowed significantly from the full width of the blade and is completely hidden by the handle material.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Scales</span> - The material applied to the sides (typically the around tang) knife to create a handle for the knife. These can be made of almost any material imaginable, see below for some of the more common materials.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Rust/Corrosion</span> - Used as synonyms to describe different forms of degradation of the metal used in knives.</li>

    <div class="header">Blade Treatment</div>
    <div class="description">Generally the goal of blade treatments is to offer further protection from the environment so as to avoid corrosion (rusting).</div>
    <ul class="definitions">
      <li><span class="label">Stonewash</span> - tumbling the blade with a mild abrasive to create a worn âsatinâ like finish</li>
      <li><span class="label">Diamond Like Carbon (DLC)</span> - A composite coating material that exhibits properties similar to that of diamond. Conceptually similar to paint, it wears much better.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Blackwash</span> - Washing the blade with a dye mixture causing build up in the recesses of the blade giving it a sort of dirty weathered look.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Protective Paint</span> - A paint like coating to the blade used to protect it from corrosion. Wears away with use.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Etching</span> - Use of a weak acid solution to remove surface material producing a pattern in the remaining steel.</li>

    <div class="header">Common Handle Materials</div>
    <div class="description">Handles can be made of just about any material imaginable, so he following is a list of some of the more common choices and is by no means all possibilites.</div>
    <ul class="definitions">
      <li><span class="label">Zytel</span> - A cast plastic material, inexpensive and durable.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Fiberglass Reinforced Nylon</span> - Just that, readily available and durable</li>
      <li><span class="label">G10</span> - A commonly used material made of fiberglass layered in an epoxy resin, very durable.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Micarta</span> - Linen layers in resin, similar to G10 but using linen instead of fiberglass.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Carbon Fiber</span> - Plastic reinforced with carbon fiber threads creating a fairly distinctive pattern.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Metal</span> - About any metal imaginable can be used, offers all sorts of options for visual appeal but generally offers poor grip characteristics.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="header">Opening Mechanisms</div>
    <ul class="definitions">
    <li><span class="label">Auto(matic)</span> - Uses a spring or springlike mechanism to propel the blade from within the handle to itâs final usable location with the push of a button, no direct manipulation of the blade is required by the user during opening. These are often illegal in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li><span class="label">Assisted</span> - Uses a spring to assist in the opening of the knife blade. The user of the knife either pushes on the thumb stud or other protrusion on the blade to start the opening process and the spring assists in the complete opening and locking of the blade.</li>
    <li><span class="label">Manual</span> - User must move the blade fully into the locked position themselves, often this is accomplished via a thumb stud on the blade.</li>
    <li><span class="label">Wave</span> - A design by Emerson Knives U.S.A. designed to be carried in a pants pocket, a small hook like protrusion on the blade is designed to catch on the material when removed from the pocket to open the blade. This design allows deploying of the knife and opening of the blade in one single movement.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="header">Blade Shapes ( needs diagrams )</div>
    <ul class="definitions">
      <li><span class="label">Drop Point</span> - The back edge of the blade runs straight from the handle to the point while curving slowly downwards towards the cutting edge.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Tanto</span> - Designed with a high point with a flat grind to create a very strong point for piercing tough materials while sacrificing slicing ability of the knife. Often appears chisel-like at the blade tip.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Spear Point</span> - A tapering symmetrical blade with the point in line with the midpoint of the bladeâs length. Provides a very strong point and is commonly seen in throwing knives.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Clip Point</span> - Back edge of the blade runs straight from the handle to about halfway down the blade then angles towards the cutting edge as it runs to the point of the blade. The line from the halfway point down towards the point can be straight or curved and looks as if it could have been clipped from blade. The standard example of this blade type is the Bowie Kfe.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Sheepsfoot</span> - Has a straight blunt back edge which curves down to meet the cutting edge at the point, creating a blunt point which makes stabbing less damaging or not practical as the point is no longer sharp. Designed for cutting or slicing in situations where a point is not desirable and allows for additional control by using the fingers on the back edge.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Dagger / Needle Point</span> - Double edged blade used for stabbing or thrusting.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Trailing Point</span> - Blade has a back edge that curves upward. Common on skinning and fillet knives, as they are designed for slicing.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Gut Hook</span> - Seemingly a variation of the trailing point, designed with a cutting hook on the back edge specifically designed to zip open the belly of game during cleaning/skinning </li>
    </ul>

      <div class="description">General Steel Formulations</div>
      <ul class="definitions">
      <li><span class="label">420</span> - A very corrosion resistant, generally softer formulation of steel often seen in lower end inexpensive knives.</li>
      <li><span class="label">420 HC</span> - A High Carbon version of the 420 series steel. The additional carbon hardens the steel significantly as compared to other 420 series steel making it more well suited for knife use. Also tends to create a much more easily sharpened blade.</li>
      <li><span class="label">440 Steel</span> There are several grades of 400 steel that have slightly different characteristics generally, however, this series offers very good corrosion resistance.</li>

      <div class="description">Stainless steel formulations made in the U.S.A. by <a href="https://www.crucible.com/">Crucible Industries</a></div>
      <ul class="definitions">
        <li><span class="label">154 CM (440C Mod)</span> - Made by Crucible, having 1.05% carbon content holds an edge well and is fairly tough. Has enhanced corrosion resistance when compared to 440C steel.</li>
        <li><span class="label">440C</span> - Commonly used in knives and surgical tools, it is a stainless steel having between 0.95% and 1.20% carbon content. Considered to be a higher end stainless steel due to it's increased chromium content (Crucible's formulation having 17.50%), and is one of the hardest stainless formulations.</li>
        <li><span class="label">CPM S30V</span> - Another Crucible formulation made specifically for knives, offers excellent corrosion resistance and superior wear resistance for maintaining an edge.</li>
        <li><span class="label">CPM S90V</span> - A Crucible formulation offering corrosion resistance equal to, or better than that of 440C while having substantial improvement in durability compared to 440C.</li>
