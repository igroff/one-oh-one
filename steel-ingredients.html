    <ul class="definitions">
      <li><span class="label">Carbon</span>This ingredient is essential to steels creation; all steel will have some amount of carbon.  It is the most important hardening element, but as it is added it can reduce the toughness of the material. Carbon reduces the amount that the knife will wear over time.  So, the amount of carbon in the blade tells you a lot about the quality of the steel.  Low carbon means there is (.3% or less), medium has between (.4-.7%), and high is (.8% and above).</li>
      <li><span class="label">Chromium</span>Combats corrosion. Stainless steel knives will have chromium as a major ingredient, typicallyat a minimum of 12%. Chromium will also increase the strength of a knife, but adding chromium in large amounts decreases toughness.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Cobalt</span>Strengthens the blade.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Copper</span>Combats corrosion.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Manganese</span>Hardens the blade. If added in high quantities it can increase brittleness.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Molybdenum</span>Maintains the steel's strength at high temperatures.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Nickel</span>Adds toughness.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Nitrogen</span>This element is sometimes used as a replacement for carbon in steel.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Phosphorus</span>Improves strength.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Silicon</span>Increases strength. Also, removes oxygen from the metal while it is being formed.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Sulfur</span>Increases machinability but decreases toughness.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Tungsten</span>Increases wear resistance.</li>
      <li><span class="label">Vanadium</span>Increases wear resistance and makes the blade harder.</li>
